# Contributing to Quotes New Tab API

Looking to contribute something to our API? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.


## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/quotesnewtab/api/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following
restrictions:

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".
  Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
  instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.

* Please **do not** open issues regarding the extension itself, this repository is reserved for the API only. If you want to report a bug or request a feature for the extension, do it [here](https://github.com/quotesnewtab/quotesnewtab/issues).


## Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent and how we use them:

- `bug` - Issues that are identifying a bug.
- `docs` - Issues for improving or updating our documentation.
- `duplicate` - Issues that already exist.
- `feature` - Issues asking for a new feature to be added, or an existing one to be extended or modified.
- `help wanted` - Issues we need or would love help from the community to resolve.
- `question` - Issues for general questions regarding the API, in most cases this can be handled by e-mail instead. See [this page](https://quotesnewtab.com/about) for contact information.
- `wontfix` - Issues with an identified bug that will not be fixed.

For a complete look at our labels, see the [project labels page](https://github.com/quotesnewtab/api/labels).


## Bug reports


Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Confirm it is an API problem** &mdash; test your own internet connection.

2. **Take note of the time** &mdash; write down the time in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) when the bug occurred.


A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue.
>
> **Endpoint:** `https://api.quotesnewtab.com/v1/quotes`
>
> **Time of bug:** 2019-04-04 16:24:38
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.
